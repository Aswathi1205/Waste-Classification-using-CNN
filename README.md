# 🗑️ Waste Classification using CNN  
Hey there! 👋 This project is all about **classifying waste** using deep learning. With the help of **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**, we aim to build a model that can recognize different types of waste from images—helping with better waste management and recycling efforts!  

## 📊 What’s Inside?  
This project does more than just training a model—it also **visualizes and analyzes** the dataset before jumping into classification. We use **Python, OpenCV, Pandas, and Matplotlib** to:  
✅ **Load and preprocess images** for classification 📷  
✅ **Analyze the dataset** and check for missing labels  
✅ **Visualize the data** with bar charts & pie charts 🥧  
✅ **Improve insights** by adding color-coded, well-structured graphs  

## 📌 Dataset  
We use a dataset from Kaggle that contains labeled images of different types of waste.  
📂 **Dataset link**: [Click here!](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data)  

## 🔧 Improvements & Features  
🔹 **Progress Updates** – Get real-time feedback while processing images  
🔹 **Smart Debugging** – Alerts if any images or labels are missing  
🔹 **Enhanced Visualizations** – Clear, color-coded charts that make data analysis easy  
🔹 **Better Readability** – Improved titles, labels, and fonts for better understanding  
🔹 **Data Insights** – Quick printouts of image counts, label distribution, and dataset stats  

## 🛠 What You Need  
Make sure you have the required libraries installed before running the project:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```
